@3000   = ~300: Warrior Class Tweaks~
@3002   = ~BERSERKER: This is a warrior who, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable him to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any person has a right to. Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes. Regardless, opponents on the battlefield will be unsettled when they see the savage and inhuman elements of the Berserker's personality. This class is common amongst dwarves, known to them as the Battlerager.

Advantages:
- May use Berserk Rage ability once per day every 4 levels. 

BERSERK: The enraged state lasts for 30 seconds, and gives +4 to constitution and strength; an extra 1/2 attack per round; immunity to all charm, hold, fear, confusion, stun, and sleep spells; a 2 point armor class penalty; and -3 penalty to saves vs breath.

Disadvantages:
- May only achieve Mastery (three sots) with melee weapons.
- May only become proficient (one slot) with ranged weapons and fighting styles.

@3058  = ~Shocking Touch~
@3059  = ~Shocking Touch

Level: 1
School: Evocation
Range: Personal
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

When the caster touches a creature while this spell is in effect, an electrical charge will deal 1d6 points of damage and stun the target for 1 round. If the target makes a successful saving throw vs. spell, he is not stunned. For every two extra experience levels of the caster, the creature will suffer an additional 1d6 points of damage and roll their saving throw at an increased -1 penalty (to a maximum of 5d6 damage and a -4 saving throw penalty at 9th level). The spell expires once the wizard attempts a melee attack or after 10 rounds have passed. The caster gains a +4 bonus to hit the target and his touch is considered to be of +1 enchantment to determine what it can hit.
~
@3060  = ~Deafness~
@3061  = ~Deafness

Level: 1
Range: 180 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Deafness spell causes the recipient to become totally unable to hear any sounds. The victim is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect. Deafened spellcasters have a 50% chance to miscast any spells. This deafness can be done away with by means of a Dispel Magic spell or a Cure Disease spell.
~
@3062  = ~Remove Magic~
@3063  = ~Remove Magic

Level: 2
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This is the combat version of Dispel Magic; it will only affect opponents. A Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the original caster, the chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is below the original caster, the chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic to be dispelled, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic to be dispelled, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.
~
@3064  = ~Spell Deflection~
@3065  = ~Minor Spell Deflection

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the spells cast against the caster to be absorbed and consumed. It affects a total of 4 spell levels, including spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard, as well as area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. As long as the spell is cast directly at the caster, it will be absorbed. This spell will only affect up to 7th-level spells, but if it tries to absorb a spell that goes over its limit, the spell will fail and the spell deflection will be canceled. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the caster, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the Spell Deflection.
~
@3066  = ~Non-Detection~
@3067  = ~Non-Detection

Level: 3

~
@3070  = ~Breach~
@3071  = ~Breach

Level: 5
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast at a creature, it breaches and dispels all of the specific and combat protections on the target creature. Here is a complete list of all the specific protection spells that are dispelled by Breach: Shield, Protection Circle, Resist Fear, Protection From Fire/Cold, Fireshield, Protection From Acid, Protection From Electricity, Protection From Magic Energy, Protection From The Elements, and Protection From Energy. The combat protection spells dispelled by Breach are Protection From Normal Missiles, Protection From Normal Weapons, Protection From Magical Weapons, Stoneskin, Armor, Ghost Armor, Spirit Armor, Absolute Immunity, Mantle, and Improved Mantle.

@3078  = ~Vocal Disruption~
@3079  = ~Vocal Disruption

Wizard Slayers have learned to produce a coarse, groaning shout that is of a particular frequency that affects the inner ear of nearby spellcasters. Such spellcasters must make a savign throw vs. Petrification or be somewhat deafened and suffer a 40% chance of spell failure for 5 rounds. The effort involved in producing this sound is such that Wizard Slayers cannot perform the feat very often before needing to rest their vocal cords.~

This ability causes the spells cast against the wizard to be deflected harmlessly away. It blocks a total of 2 spell levels, including spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities (but excludes area effects that are not aimed directly at the wizard).

Additionally, the target must save vs. spells or be deafened for 5 rounds, resulting in a 50% chance of miscast magic. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

The spells affected by Ruby Ray Of Reversal are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. This will always remove the highest-level spell protection affecting the target; if more than one same-level protection is active on the target simultaneously, one of them will be randomly chosen and dispelled.

Additionally, if the target fails a save vs. spells, the target will be blinded by the Ruby Ray for 3 rounds. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

When this spell is cast, it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses. The target's Magic Resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. Next, Pierce Shield will cancel one spell protection of any level. The list of spells that this includes: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, and Spell Trap. Finally, Pierce Shield will cancel the target's magical combat protections, such as Shield or Stoneskin (but specific protections, such as Resistance to Fire, will remain).

Magic Resistance does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster. It cannot be dispelled.~

Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed, making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if hit by a Flame Arrow (a 3rd-level spell), the caster will get three spell levels back—e.g. one spell of up to 3rd level in power. It excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard, it will be reflected back upon the caster. This spell will only affect up to 4th-level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining, a spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed and will exhaust the protection.

This spell will absorb and protect against a total of 5 spell levels of magic directed at the caster. It will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

This spell creates an incredibly powerful barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap—making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if a wizard is protected by Spell Trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd-level spell), the wizard will get three spell levels back—e.g. one spell up to 3rd level in power. 

The Spell Trap is remarkably stable, remaining in place for 4 hours unless dispelled or exhausted. It provides 30 levels of protection (i.e., ten Flame Arrows or five Fingers of Death). The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.~

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular first level spells, creates up to four missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. The spell fires two missiles at 1st level, three at 5th level, and a maximum of four at 9th level.~
@6098   = ~Sorcerer~
@6099   = ~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear any armor.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May not place any slots in any fighting style.
– May cast arcane spells.
– May not scribe spells into their spellbooks as Mages do. Instead, Sorcerers learn a small number of spells at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.

Saving Throw: Special

A Grease spell causes the surface of the ground to take on a slippery, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively. Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly, for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Spell again the following round). Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it gives the protected creature a magical insight into the minds of any nearby creatures with evil intent. The slight foreknowledge that results causes all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures to receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Summoned demons and fiends are acutely affected by this spell; evil is woven into their very beings. Therefore, they are completely unable to target the protected creature.~

Level: 3
Range: 0 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When a mirror image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck.  However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~

This spell was created by an Invoker wizard who was convinced that he was being stalked by assassins with the ability to become invisible. Unfortunately, he had no skill with Divination spells. This spell showers glittering golden particles in the area of effect. Enemies must roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell or be blinded (-4 penalty to attack rolls and Armor Class) for 4 rounds. In addition, all enemies who fail their Saving Throw are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades, thus revealing invisible creatures. The dust fades in 4 rounds.~

Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell begins with one or more common arrows or bolts, superheats them, and then hurls fiery bolts at opponents at very high speed. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster receives one bolt every 5 levels beyond the 5th (2 bolts at 10th level, 3 at 15th level, etc.). All of the bolts will streak toward the target of the spell.~

Saving Throw: None

The spell grants the caster the ability to understand and subtly manipulate the flow of time, making any following spells more likely to be successful and effective. The practical result is to adversely affect all enemy Saving Throws. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect, who make all saving throws at a penalty of -4.~

Saving Throw: None

This spell advances on effects like Reflected Image and Mislead by attempting to give the created double some degree of form and autonomy. It is only partially successful - the double is blurry and shapeless, and lacks the personality and control of the caster. But it will fight on the caster's behalf and remain in relatively stable form for up to 9 hours (unless it meets a violent demise).~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard temporarily imbues a normal blade with magical power and a will of its own. The sword will float in the air completely under the caster's control. (This does not prevent the caster from doing any other actions during the spell's duration.) The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and deals 5d4 points of damage upon hitting a target.~

This spell creates violent whorls of magical energy within the area of effect which do grievous harm to all enemies, inflicting 1d8 damage per level of the caster.

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster becomes a Grand Master in the use of the weapon. It acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 Hit Points.~

Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates phantasmal visions of unimaginable horror in the mind of all enemies in the area of effect. The spell is risky because such intense and unreal illusions may be disbelieved (subjects may avoid the effects if they make a saving throw vs. death). But affected creatures who fail their save are so drastically affected that they die instantly.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the result of a Necromancer dipping his toes into the Diviner's sphere of influence. With it, an actual eyeball is enchanted to float around and send visual information to the caster's mind. The Wizard Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers prevent the passage of a Wizard Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~

Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  This has the  practical effect of draining the victim of 4 levels of experience. The target loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently - they can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  There is no saving throw to resist the effect.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~

It sprays a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. The sparkling dust dazzles all opponents in the area (-2 penalty to attack rolls) for 4 rounds and reveals any opponents who are invisible. Those affected must also save vs. breath to avoid becoming completely covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle for 4 rounds. Those failing the save remain unable to successfully hide themselves until the dust fades.~

Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns

Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes a number of illusory duplicates of himself to come into being around him. The spell creates two images plus one for every 3 levels of the caster (up to a maximum of eight images at 18th level). These images do exactly what the wizard does, and since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is directly struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, while other existing images remain intact. It is important to note that this will not protect the caster against all attacks, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is under the effects of a Reflected Image spell, and casting the spell multiple times will not multiply the number of images created.~

A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage.

It has 100% resistance to almost all forms of damage (acid, cold, fire, electricity, poison, etc.), and 95% resistance to physical damage, but it is vulnerable to pure magic damage. The sword is immune to mind affecting spells, has 36 hit points, AC 5, and THAC0 2. Note that this spell does not prevent the caster from performing any other actions while the spell is in effect.~

This spell creates violent whorls of magical energy within the area of effect which do grievous harm to all enemies, inflicting 1d8 damage per level of the caster. Affected creatures are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, who receive a penalty of -2 to their Saving Throws.~
@6139  = ~Black Blade of Disaster
Level: 8
School: Enchantment
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster wields the blade as if proficient with the weapon, and brandishes it with a base THAC0 of 0. The sword deals 2d12 damage per strike, and acts as a +5 magical weapon in all regards, including hit and damage bonuses. With each hit, there is a 15% chance the victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 or be disintegrated (40d6 points of magic damage, 5d6 on a successful save).~
@6140  = ~Weird
Level: 9
School: Illusion
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates phantasmal visions of unimaginable horror in the mind of all enemies in the area of effect. The spell is risky because such intense and unreal illusions may be disbelieved (subjects may avoid the effects if they make a saving throw vs. death). But affected creatures who fail their save are so drastically affected that they die instantly.~
@6141   = ~Larloch's Energy Drain~
@6142   = ~Larloch's Energy Drain
Level: 8
School: Necromancy
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  The practical effect is to drain the victim 4 levels of experience - levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities are lost permanently.  These can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  As the life force passes through the caster, it temporarily invigorates him, granting him an additional 20 hit points, a +4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, and +20% bonus to every skill.  These effects last for 1 hour.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell, and there is no saving throw to avoid the Drain.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~

@6252   = ~Chill Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, a blue glow encompasses his hand. This energy attacks the life force of any living creature upon which the wizard makes a successful melee attack. The touched creature suffers 1d4+1 points of cold damage and must save vs. Death or be Slowed and lose three points of Strength for two rounds. 

Undead touched by this energy are Held for two rounds. They do not receive a savign throw to avoid the effect.~
@6253   = ~Ghoul Touch~
@6254   = ~Ghoul Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, a red glow encompasses his hand. On a successful touch, the spell inflicts 1d4+1 points of magic damage. If the victim fails a saving throw vs. death, the spell continues to do 1d4 damage in the second round and 1d3 damage in the third round. Furthermore, the victim is paralyzed for 1 round and infected with a disease that saps his Strength, Dexterity and Constitution by two points each for five rounds.~
@6255   = ~Vampiric Touch~
@6256   = ~Vampiric Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, his hand is encompassed by a pale blue fire. Anyone successfully attacked by the necromancer loses 1d6+1 hit points, while the necromancer gains 1d6+1 hit points (any hit points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional hit points, lasting for 4 turns). Upon failing a saving throw vs. death with a -2 penalty, the victim loses 1d6 more hit points and also suffers a loss of 3 points of Constitution for one turn. 

Any undead touch by the necromancer while this ability is active are placed under the necromancer's control for five rounds.~

Level: 1
School: Necromancy
Range: Long
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to his own. The target creature suffers 1d4+1 points of damage, while the mage gains 1d4+1 hit points. For every three levels of the caster, the draining repeats one round later. The maximum duration of five rounds is reached by 12-level necromancers.

If the mage goes over his maximum hit point total with this spell, he loses it after 1 turn.~
@6262   = ~Ray of Enfeeblement~

Level: 2
School: Necromancy
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: vs. Death

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard launches a magical attack against the vitality of an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim's Strength score is automatically reduced by 4 points for the duration of the spell. Additionally, if the target fails a saving throw vs. Death, the Strength penalty is doubled to -8, and the victim suffers the effects of a Slow spell (half movement rate and -4 penalties to thac0 and AC). These effects last for 1 turn.~
@6351   = ~Contingency~
@6352   = ~Contingency
Upon using this ability, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell from his repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed (rounded up), up to 7th-level spells at 19th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster can choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.

For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a Contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of his Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% max Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.~

(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the Wild Mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the Mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Nahal's Reckless Dweomer simply cast it, then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the Wild Mage will try to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (see the manual for more details).

Because the release of energy is planned by the Mage, <PRO_HISHER> level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the Mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result might be beneficial to the Mage, or it might be completely disastrous: This is the risk the Mage takes in casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.~

This spell protects the target from all forms of death magic for the duration of the spell. This includes, but is not limited to, Disintegrate, Power Word Kill, Death Spell and Finger of Death.

Woodscouts combine the abilities of rangers and clerics.  It is said that Mielikki has received a special dispensation from Silvanus to grant her Woodscouts access to powerful druidic magic, so that they might better protect nature and champion the cause of justice.

Combining martial skill with magical prowess, Bladesingers have the resources to face nearly any threat.  They master the use of long blades wielded in one hand, keeping the other free for spellcasting.

Bladesingers begin at level 1 with proficiency in Single-Weapon Style.  At level 7, this automatically increases to specialization.  They may reach grandmastery with long swords, scimitars, and katanas, and may only reach basic proficiency with other one-handed weapons and missile weapons.  They may not become proficient with two-handed weapons or in any other fighting style.

Once per day per 6 levels, a bladesinger may perform the Bladesong, a dance in which a blade is spun and whirled faster than the eye can follow, blocking incoming attacks and devastating enemies.  Upon beginning the Bladesong, for 24 seconds, the bladesinger has a +1 bonus to thac0 per 5 levels, a -2 bonus to AC vs. melee attacks per five levels, one extra attack per round, faster movement rate, and all successful attacks do maximum damage.

@7033   = ~The Spellfilchers are hidden society of very specialized thieves.  They hone their abilities toward a dangerous goal: stealing magic from wizards.  To that end, Spellfilchers have a few special tricks they can employ when confronted by angry mages.

First, they may cast the priest spell "Silence 15' Radius" to prevent an enemy from casting spells. Of course many wizards know the Vocalize spell to overcome such a disadvantage, but a skilled Spellfilcher knows that the time it takes to do so may make all the difference in the world.

Second, at 5th level Spellfilchers can cast a special variant of "Spell Turning" which lasts for 12 hours.  It will only turn back a single spell, but doing so may give a Spellfilcher the time he or she needs to get better spell protections up if surprised.  Spellfilchers commonly erect this protection every morning, before even brushing their teeth.

Third, at 9th level Spellfilchers become innately and permanently protected by the effect of the spell "Non-detection," enabling them to use their thiefly abilities to hide even from wizards with powerful scrying magic.

Finally, every time a Spellfilcher successfully strikes a wizard with a melee attack, the target must save vs. rods/wands or suffer a 33% chance of miscast magic for 2 rounds.

Mask grants his Nightrunners a few special abilities to advance his cause.  From first level, they may create a Shadow Eye, an invisible floating eye through which the Nightrunner can scout distant locations.  From 4th level, Nightrunners can suddenly disappear from sight via a magical Shadow Door.  And at 8th level, they gain the ability to conjure a creature of pure shadow to fight on their behalf.

Their deeds are fraught with both peril and annoyance, but they are never boring!

Misadventurers are given special abilities by Brandobaris to get out of any trouble they may find themselves in.  First, they are very difficult to strike in battle, gaining a -1 bonus to AC for each 7 levels of experience.  Second, from 4th level they may Haste themselves to escape harm.  Finally, from 8th level they may create Scattering Images of themselves to confuse opponents.  When struck by a weapon, there is a chance that the blow will land on an illusory image, instead of upon the misadventurer.

Alaghors share some abilities with the famed Dwarven Defenders, though they do not focus as much on melee durability.  Once per day, an Alaghor may use the Hardiness power, gaining 35% resistance to physical attacks for one round per two levels of experience.

Alaghors also have an innate ability to create a Spiritual Hammer of Clangeddin.  This weapon of magical force does d4+1 blunt damage and d4 magic damage to foes, and has a chance to briefly Hold undead struck by it.

They revel in bloody struggle but also ensure that battles are conducted honorably.

Glorybloods have an innate ability to create a Spiritual Axe of Tempus.

It is wielded as if the bearer is specialized (2 stars) in its use. These abilities increase as the Gloryblood rises in level.

Glorybloods also have the ability to enter an enraged state, similar to a barbarian.

Monitors are in tune with magical energies in a way that few spellcasters can match; they can create effects with a power level beyond their nominal experience.

But, as with any rigid system, the are gaps and shortcuts that may be used to circumvent Mystra's rules. Sorcerers are born with the ability to focus the Weave directly, though only into a limited number of effects. Wild mages shape spells without discipline, achieving powerful results at the risk of disastrous side-effects.

Unlike those classes, Spellbenders make a science of mapping the ways to bypass Mystra's restrictions. Practicing as generalist clerics and studying arcane magery, they learn to manipulate the intersection of those two areas of magic. They may sacrifice a memorized wizard spell to instead create one of numerous divine effects; and they may sacrifice a memorized cleric spell to create an arcane effect. Some energy is lost in the translation - the improvisational effects must be spells of lower level than the one sacrificed.
