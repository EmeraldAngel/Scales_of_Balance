<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is all about improving gameplay. While I love mods that bring the game closer to PnP, like Rogue Rebalancing and aTweaks, BG is a single-player computer game. If tweaking a rule makes this specific game more fun, then it's a good tweak, PnP be damned. Consider this mod as a collection of 'house rules' specific to the BG campaign. Every choice has been made with an eye to the particular gameplay mechanics of BG2 and the EEs.</p>
  <p>I call this a "post-hac tweak mod" because it is designed to be installed on top of - not instead of - all the other great mods out there.  I began with a BGT game with over 75 mods; they made the game great, but a few things still irked me, like druid shapechanges and the the archer's called shots and awkwardly fourth-wall-breaking weapon names. (<i>Holy sword +6? Really? That's a punchline, not a game feature.</i>) I made a bunch of little tweaks, then I learned Weidu for easy re-installation, and then I learned more.  Before I knew it I had 30 components altering many different aspects of the game.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Everything is completely optional.  You can use as many or as few of the mod components as you want.  None of them rely on each other, there is no 'core' component. Use what you like, ignore what you don't.</u></strong> </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows:</strong><br />
    The mod archive should be extracted into your game folder from the archive (or just unzipped and then copied there). If properly extracted, you should have an "SoB" folder and "setup-SoB.exe" in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click "setup-SoB.exe" and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-SoB.exe in your BG2 folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X:</strong><br />
    This mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your game folder. If properly extracted, you should have a folder called "SoB," a file called "weidu," and the "WeiDU Mac Launcher" in your BG2 directory. To install, simply double-click the WeiDU Launcher, choose Scales of Balance from the list, and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Scales of Balance is designed to work with any Infinity Engine game on a variant of the BG2 engine that someone might purchase and play today, in 2014. At the moment, that includes TOB, TuTu, BGT, BG:EE, BG2:EE, and IWD:EE.</p>
  <p>Scales of Balance aims to be compatible with almost all other popular mods. There are however a few compatibility issues of note:<br />
  <ul>
  	<li>Some of the tweaks here cover the same ground as other tweak mods. This should hopefully be pretty obvious: I have modified spell tables, and <u>BG2Tweaks</u> has modified spell tables, so you should pick one or the other - don't install both. Other overlaps with <u>BG2Tweaks</u> are my hit dice component and their changes to level-up hit dice; my Weapon Proficiency Overhaul and their proficiency changes; my changes to stat bonuses and various other mods' changes to stat bonuses... etc. Like I say, these kinds of overlaps should be pretty obvious.</li><br />
  	<li>I have not tested compatibility with Kit Revisions. These two mods cover a lot of the same ground. Eventually (after KR is released, anyway) I will try to see if I can make them work well together. But for now, you should probably choose one or the other. (You may try to skip the SoB tweaks and only install new kits, and/or the multiclass component... it should work, but there might be balance issues.)</li><br />
  	<li>The first component of <u>Rogue Rebalancing</u> is not compatible, and not necessary, with SoB's component #120 "the Weapon Proficiency Overhaul." </li><br />
  	<li>Most of SoB's overhauls and class tweaks are incompatible with the first, "core" component of <u>Six's Kitpack</u>. Take a look at what each mod does and decide which one you want to use.</li><br />
  	<li>The <u>Hidden Kits</u> mods is probably extremely incompatible. You can try to use them together but you might see some very weird behavior, like innate abilities changing or disappearing - if not even worse symptoms.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>See the component descriptions below for more specific information about compatibility.</p>
  <p><strong>Load Order:</strong><br />
    Scales of Balance should be installed <strong>after</strong> all other mods that add or change creatures, items or kits. It should be installed <strong>after</strong> the "WSPATCK for All" component of <u>tb#Tweaks</u>.  It should be just about the last thing you install, with the exception of something like Generalized Biffing, Level1NPCs, NPC_EE, lolfixer, etc.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 101: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Item & Weapon Overhaul ("IWO") part 1: Aesthetic & Enchantment Tweaks</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component removes "+1," "+2," etc. from item names, and standardizes the enchantment levels of weapons for purposes of which enemies they can hit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Generic +1 weapons become "Mastercraft" weapons, forged with unusual materials and skill that enable them to strike enemies who are immune to normal weapons.</li>
      <li> Generic +2 and +3 weapons become "Enchanted" weapons, with the enchantment level and stats of +2 weapons.</li>
      <li> All named weapons that were formerly from +1 to +4, become +3 weapons for purposes of what they can hit - though their bonuses and magical abilities remain unchanged.</li>
      <li> All upgraded weapons and originally +5/+6 weapons become +5 for purposes of what they can hit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(This component does not work on IWDEE - too many items are defined and recognized by the "plus" in their names and descriptions.</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers the same ground as the SCS component "Make +1 Weapons Into Fine Weapons." This component also has other effects, of course. You should not install that component of SCS if you want to use this component.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 102: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>IWO part 2: Functional Weapon Tweaks</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component makes tweaks to the base characteristics of various items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Spears do 1d8+1 damage, since in BG games they are of the 2-handed variety (this is per PnP).</li>
      <li> Quarterstaves seem better suited to defensive parrying than many other weapons, so they get an inherent -1 AC bonus.</li>
      <li> Daggers get 1.5 base APR. (A thief with Rogue Rebalancing, dual-wielding daggers, should be a reasonable and interesting choice.)</li>
      <li> Flails do 1d8+1 damage.</li>
      <li> Axes do "slashing or crushing" damage.</li>
      <li> Short swords do "slashing or piercing" damage.</li>
      <li> Crossbow bolts do 2d4 damage.</li>
      <li> Arrows do 1d5 damage from shortbows; longbows and composite bows have their base APR reduced to 3/2 but do an extra +2 damage.</li>
      <li> Sling bullets do blunt damage.</li>
      <li> Darts have 5/2 APR instead of 3.</li>
      <li> In the EE games, strength damage bonuses are removed from all thrown/launched weapons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers some of the same ground as the "Weapon Changes" component of Item Revisions. I, for one, use both together. But be aware that this might compound or override some of the IR component's effects.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 103: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>IWO part 3: Distinctions between Light and Heavy Weapons</em></strong></p>
    <p>Light, low-damage weapons get a +1 thac0 bonus. So beginning adventurers will be better off using light, simple weapons until they gain experience and their thac0 improves - unless they are strong enough to wield the heavy weapons comfortably, or they are skilled in a weapon style that grants thac0 bonuses. These weapons include short swords, daggers, clubs, war hammers, spears, and quarterstaves.</p>
    <p>Heavy weapons that are inappropriate for dual-wielding get a -1 penalty to off-hand thac0. These include bastard swords, katanas, and flails.</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers the same ground as the "Dual-Wielding Changes for Light and Heavy Weapons" component of Item Revisions. You can probably use both together, but the effects will be compounded and will likely be somewhat extreme. Best to choose one or the other.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 104: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>IWO part 4: IWDEE-specific Tweaks</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component patches IWDEE items in several different ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Weapons for sale by Conlan have their prices normalized a bit.</li>
      <li> The Black Knight and White Bishop figurines are usable once per day instead of once ever.</li>
      <li> Melee weapons "of Action" are changed a bit: instead of giving bonus APR, they *set* base APR higher.</li>
      <li> Weapons "of Action" +2 that previously only gave +1 DEX now give an extra 1/2 APR as well.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 121: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Weapon Proficiency Overhaul ("WPO") part 1: Weapon Category Combination</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component groups certain proficiencies together:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Two-handed swords and bastard swords are combined into a "greatswords" proficiency.</li>
        <li> Scimitars, katanas, and wakizashi are combined into a "curved swords" proficiency.</li>
        <li> Spears and halberds are combined into a "polearms" proficiency.</li>
        <li> Daggers and darts are combined into a "knives" proficiency.</li>
        <li> Long bows and short bows are combined into a "bows" proficiency.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component is probably not compatible with stuff like the weapon proficiency changes in Tweaks Anthology. Choose one proficiency system mod and stick with it.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 122: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>WPO part 2: Proficiency System Overhaul</em></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Please note, this component can only be installed on an EE or TobEx game.  And you <u>must</u> install the "Category Combination" component first.</strong></p>
      <p>This component can be considered a convenience tweak; it will give most classes substantially more proficiency points to spend. But it incentivizes spreading those points more widely instead of focusing on a single weapon (like the vanilla game), and your overall level of power at any given moment should roughly on par with an unmodded game. The aim is, with more points in more weapons, when you complete a quest and find a wonderful magical artifact, you can actually *use* it instead of just tossing it into your pack to sell later.</p>
      <p>Weapon use is slightly liberalized: all weapons are usable by clerics, but single-class clerics can only be proficient in traditional cleric weapons (the exception being kitted clerics' favored weapons.) Multiclass clerics primarily benefit from this: cleric/thieves can use thief weapons, and fighter/clerics can use any weapon.</p>
      <p>Clubs are truly universal, simple weapons: everyone can use them.  Crossbows are usable by everyone except druids and Beastmasters.</p>
      <p>Fighters start with 9 proficiency points and gain a new one every other level. But they cannot place more than one point in any weapon or style at first level; they cannot reach specialization (++) until 2nd level. Paladins, rangers, barbarians and rogues begin with 6 proficiency points, and gain a new one every 3 levels. Druids and clerics begin with 5 proficiency points, and gain a new one every 5 levels. Wizards begin with 4 proficiency points, and can never move past their initial proficiencies (NB - dual-classing into a mage means no more weapon advancement <strong>at all!</strong>).  All multiclasses gain a new point every 3 levels, except cleric/mages, who gain a new point every 5 levels.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Trueclass fighters and Kensai can attain Grandmastery (+++++) in any weapons they focus on. </li>
        <li> Other kitted fighters, plus barbarians, paladins, and rangers can attain High Mastery (++++). </li>
        <li> Thieves, bards, and druids can attain Mastery (+++) with any weapons they can normally use. </li>
        <li> Clerics can attain specialization (++) with most weapons, but kitted clerics will gain Mastery (+++) with their deity's chosen weapon. </li>
        <li> Multiclass fighter/mages can attain High Mastery (++++) in any weapon but the only available style is Single-Weapon Style. </li>
        <li> Fighter/clerics and Fighter/thieves can attain High Mastery (++++) in any weapon they can use. </li>
        <li> Mage/thieves and cleric/thieves can attain Mastery (+++) with any weapon they can use. </li>
        <li> Cleric/Mages can attain Specialization (++) with any weapon they can use. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beyond that, certain kits will be able to reach 1 point higher or lower in certain weapons (e.g. Archers can reach (+++++) with missile weapons, and only (+++) with melee weapons). </p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>Proficiency benefits (cumulative totals)<br />
        &ndash; * = +0.5 APR from leve 7<br />
        &ndash; ** = +1 thac0; +2 damage; +0.5 APR from level 1<br />
        &ndash; *** = +2 thac0; +2 damage; +0.5 APR from level 1, +1 APR at level 7<br />
        &ndash; **** = +3 thac0; +3 damage; +0.5 APR from level 1, +1 APR at level 7, +1.5 APR at level 11<br />
        &ndash; ***** = +4 thac0; +5 damage; +0.5 APR from level 1, +1 APR at level 7, +1.5 APR at level 11, +2 APR at level 15<br />.</p>
      </div>
        So fighters can reach (+++++) by level 8, but it will only grant them +1 total APR bonus at that point.  Players might choose to spend those point on other weapons instead, to gain immediate APR bonuses with a more diverse set of weapons.</p>
        <p>(These APR bonuses will only affect warriors, unless you also install the WPO part 5, "APR on Spec.")
      <p>This component also tweaks the thac0 tables: Rogues' thac0 is buffed, making it equal to clerics. Their progression is smoothed out, no more jumping by 2. Warriors start at thac0 20, and non-warriors start at thac0 21.</p>
      <p>This component makes serious changes and it has been extremely hard to get various game mechanisms to work with it, especially dual-classing and NPCs. As a result, <b>ALL</b> NPCs you meet except dual-classed ones will be dropped to level 1, TOB-style, and start with selected base proficiencies. They will have the normal amount of XP however, so you can immediately level them up and direct their advancement.  Because this method doesn't work well for dual-classed NPCs, Imoen, Anomen, and Nalia, will instead receive a special "Proficiency Tome" that you can use to set their proficiencies.</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component is probably not compatible with stuff like the weapon proficiency changes in Tweaks Anthology. Choose one proficiency system mod and stick with it.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 123: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>WPO part 3: Hardcore Dual-Classing Rules</em></strong></p>
      <p>PLEASE NOTE, THIS COMPONENT HAS BEEN DISABLED WHILE I FIX AND EXTEND IT. APOLOGIES.</p>
      <p>This component aims to fix a longstanding bug in the games: when you dual-class, your weapon proficiency advancement is supposed to be capped by your <strong>new</strong> class, not your old one. In BG you can start with a fighter, dual to thief at level 2, and still proceed to Grandmastery with bastard swords.  No more!  Now, when you dual-class from one of the eight base warrior kits (Fighter, Wizard Slayer, Berserker, Kensai, Ranger, Archer, Beastmaster, or Stalker) you will be limited to Mastery (+++) in any future advancement.</p>
      <p>If you install this component <i>without</i> having first installed component 122, it will cap advancement at specialization (++).</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 124: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>WPO part 4: Weapon Style Overhaul</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component <b>(which is EE-only)</b> rebalances fighting styles in order to make them each more distinct and useful (instead of everything playing 2nd-fiddle to dual-wielding).  All style get thac0 bonuses in addition to other benefits.  So especially at low levels, it might be worth investing in a style for benefits that work for all weapons, rather than progressing in a single weapon proficiency.  The benefits of each style are listed below (cumulative totals):</p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>Single-Weapon Style: now called <b>"Finesse"</b><br />
        &ndash; (+) = +1 thac0, -1 AC, +5% crit chance<br />
        &ndash; (++) = +2 thac0, -2 AC, +10% crit chance</p>
        <p>Sword & Shield Style: now called <b>"Shield-Fighting"</b><br />
        &ndash; (+) = +1 thac0, -1 AC<br />
        &ndash; (++) = +2 thac0, -2 AC</p>
        <p>Two-Handed Weapon Style: now called <b>"Two-Hand Style"</b><br />
        &ndash; (+) = +1 thac0, +2 damage<br />
        &ndash; (++) = +2 thac0, +4 damage</p>
        <p>Two-Weapon Style: now called <b>"Dual-Wielding"</b><br />
        &ndash; ( ) = -5 main-hand thac0, and -3 off-hand thac0<br />
        &ndash; (+) = -4 main-hand thac0, and -2 off-hand thac0<br />
        &ndash; (++) = -3 main-hand thac0, and -1 off-hand thac0<br />
        &ndash; (+++) = -2 main-hand thac0, and no penalty to off-hand thac0<br />.</p>
      </div>
      <p>If you have installed the "IWO part 3: Distinctions between Light and Heavy Weapons," then the penalties for dual-wielding will be increased by 1 point, to offset the doubled thac0 bonuses for light weapons in that component.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 125: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>WPO part 5: APR on Spec</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component <b>(which is EE-only)</b> enables any class to gain APR benefits from weapon specialization - not just warriors.</p>
      <p>(NB if you install component 122 without this one, only warriors will get the benefit of the APR bonus for basic proficiency.)</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component is not compatible with the APR on Spec component of Tweaks Anthology (which I wrote, and is based on this one). The other version is specifically designed for the vanilla proficiency system; this one is specifically designed for the WPO proficiency system.

  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 180: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Magic Resistance Overhaul ("MRO")</em></strong></p>
    <p>WARNING: This component makes very severe changes to the way the game works, and has not been extensively tested for its effects on game balance. It should be considered as 'beta' quality. Its purpose is to largely (but not completely) remove the probability-based "magic resistance" mechanic from the game. It makes the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All creatures in the game, such as drow, dragons, skeleton warriors, etc., will have their MR set to zero. Instead, they will receive +3 bonuses to saving throws vs. Breath, Petrification, and Wands, and a +6 bonus to saving throws vs. Spells. (No bonus to saves vs. Death - this should make necromancy magic a little stronger and more special.)</li>
      <li>Monks and Wizard Slayers will not get MR; instead, they will get a +1 bonus to all saving throws at level 1, and at every 4th level thereafter (5th, 9th, 13th, etc. up to 25th).</li>
      <li>Almost all items in the game that grant MR have been changed. Some, like the Amulet of Magic Resistance, have their MR converted into resistance to all elemental and magic damage. Others, like Carsomyr, instead get large bonuses to saving throws. Some are very different, like the Sword of Balduran which now grants a movement rate bonus.</li>
      <li>It is still possible to get *some* MR, from the Hell Trials and the Machine of Lum the Mad. That's okay, 15% MR isn't game-breaking... it's only when it is stacked that it causes problems.</li>
      <li>Likewise, the "Magic Resistance" spell is left untouched, it can be used as another form of magic protection along with the likes of Spell Deflections and Globes of Invulnerability. Lower Resistance, Pierce Magic, and Pierce Shield are still effective against this spell, and SCS enemies will use them against you.</li>
    </ul></p> 
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 200: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Stat Bonuses</em></strong></p>
      <p>STR, DEX, and WIS bonuses are modified so that every point added above 13 (or so) results in a tangible benefit:<br />
      <ul>
      	<li>The 18/xx "exceptional" Strength doesn't work in BG like it does in PnP; ALL bonuses are supposed to go up that table in steps (including for non-warriors). BG makes it so that the 1-point jump from 18 to 19 is a bigger difference than the <strong>5-point</strong> jump from 13 to 18. I fix that by, essentially, collapsing the 18/xx values to all be about the same.  Bonuses are pushed downward, so there is now almost the same difference between 14 and 15 as there is between 18 and 19.</li><br />
      	<li>Dexterity bonuses are also pushed lower and spread out a bit more. 14 DEX gives -1 AC; 15 gives +1 missile thac0; 16 gives another -1 AC; 17 gives another +1 to missile thac0; etc.</p>
      	<li>Intelligence is no longer a dump-stat. Bards and wizards get an extra spell of each level for as many points of intelligence they have above 12 - so, an extra 1st-level spell for 13 INT, and an extra spell of level 1 through 9 at 21 INT. (This is only measured once, however - drinking a potion for bonus INT points will not give you extra spells.) In addition, at 15 INT the player has a +1 bonus rolling for critical hits; at 17 INT this is a +2 bonus, and at 19 INT it is a +3 bonus to crit. (To make up for this, *everyone* will have a -1 penalty to crit rolls.  So the only way to score critical hits is to have 15 or greater INT, or to have points in Single-Weapon Style or Two-Handed Style.)</p>
      	<li>Wisdom now grants an extra 1st-level priest spell at 13 and at 14; and extra 2nd-level spell at 15 and at 16; an extra 3rd-level spell at 17 and at 18; et cetera, up to 2 extra spells of every level at 25 WIS</p>
      	<li>Charisma is not a dump stat either! Charisma now measures something like 'spirit' or 'karma' at the beginning of a character's career. Upon creating a character, 16 CHA will grant a +1 bonus to saves. At 17 CHA this bonus will be +2. At 18 CHA the character is also granted a permanent +1 Luck, and at 19 CHA this grows to +2 Luck. (Note, this takes the place of so-called "shorty save bonuses" associated with CON, which are removed. Note also, this will not apply to paladins, who get save bonuses automatically, to reflect the strength of their spirit.)</p>
      	<li>Constitution bonuses are folded into Component #210, Modified Hit Points, below.</p>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, to make more meaningful differences between races, demihumans will have more stat bonuses and penalties.  The racial maximums are now:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Elves: 19 Dex, 19 Int, 17 Str, 16 Con</li>
        <li> Half-elf: 19 Cha, 17 Wis</li>
        <li> Dwarf: 19 Con, 17 Dex, 16 Cha</li>
        <li> Halfling: 19 Dex, 19 Cha, 17 Int, 16 Str</li>
        <li> Gnome: 19 Int, 19 Con, 17 Str, 16 Wis</li>
        <li> Half-orc: 19 Str, 17 Int, 16 Cha</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 205: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Hit Point Tables</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component takes some of the randomness out of hit point rolls. In the vanilla system, a warrior with 16 CON can actually get *fewer* hit points at level-up than a mage with 8 CON. That only leads to annoying reloads or constant moving of the difficulty bar to get max hp (which is just too cheaty, and perverts various game mechanics). With this component, there are still rolls, but the roll will always seem fair and should never cause you to feel you need to reload or go below Core difficulty. That 16 CON warrior will get between 9 and 12 hit points per level, instead of from 3 to 12. Higher average rolls, and more satisfying numbers, but not overpowered.<br />
      <ul>
      	<li>Wizard hit dice is now 1d3+1. Rogue and priest hit dice is 2d3+1. And warrior hit dice is 3d3+1 (3d4+1 for barbarians).</li>
      	<li>Everyone gets an extra hit point at 15 CON and 16 CON (like vanilla), plus an extra hit point at 21, 23, and 25 CON (so stat-boosting spells and effects can actually increase your hit points). Warriors also get a bonus hit point at 18 CON.</li>
      	<li>The minimum roll for those d3 rolls is 2 at 14 CON, and 3 at 17 CON. (So 17 CON means max hit points.)</li>
      	<li>Everyone gets very slow hit point regeneration (1 hp per 2 turns) at 19 CON. The regeneration speeds up a bit at 20 CON (1 per turn), 21 CON (1 per 4 rounds), 22 CON (1 per 2 rounds), 23 CON (1 per round), 24 CON (2 per round), and 25 CON (1 per second).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, this smooths out the decline in added hp. Everyone stops getting hit dice after 8th level. After that:
      <ul>
      	<li>Warriors get 4/level from 10 to 15, then 3/level from 16 to 25, and 2/level after that. </li>
      	<li>Rogues and priests get 3/level from 10 to 15, 2/level from 16 to 25, and 1 per level after that. </li>
      	<li>Wizards get 2/level from 10 to 15, and 1/level after that. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, I have added an alternate hardcore version of this component, which eliminates 1 hp from each class (so wizards are 1d3, rogues/priests are 2d3, and warriors are 3d3). The regular component should give hit points somewhere between the vanilla game's mean and max values; the hardcore variant should result in hit points closer to the mean. </p>

  <h4 class="subheader">Component 210: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised XP Tables</em></strong></p>
      <p>XP advancement and thac0/spell/skill advancement are two ends of the same rope; you only need to pull on one end to get the desired effect, but for some reason the 2e rules pull both. I've streamlined it to a fast path and a slow path. Fighters, thieves, bards, and clerics are on the faster table; paladins, rangers, druids and wizards are on the slower table. (No more thieves with more hp than fighters with the same XP!) Advancement is a bit faster than vanilla in the middle levels, and then gets progressively slower at epic levels. You'll be at or near level 20 with 3 million XP, like in vanilla; but won't hit level 30 until 8 million XP. HLAs will be rarer with this component, so choose wisely!</p>
      <p>This component also switches the druid spellcasting table to match the priest one (since the PnP druid XP and spell tables were only for Grand/Hierophant Druids who settle down in a grove and stop adventuring).</p>
